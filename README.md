# Creepy-Music-SelfBot
Ez Discord Music SelfBot Made With Love
## What is this shit ?

This project is a **SelfBot** in **[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)**. It's made to do the same actions as **[MUSIC BOT]**  while being a selfbot, this mean it can be used with a user account. This has many advantages, for example you can use it on any servers you're in, even without permissions.

```sh  \
 "SelfBot" \ # Optionnal, you can change it
 "TOKEN=Your Discord Token" \ #Required in Bot Config
 "PREFIX=A Prefix" \ #Optionnal, default is !!
 "npm i " \ #چیزای مهم بات نصب میشه دیگ گاییدی

```

  * **`$join`**
▶️ _makes the selfbot move to the voice channel you're in (music needs to be playing)_
  * **`$skip`**
